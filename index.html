            <h2> What is Haiku?</h2>
                <p>
                A haiku is traditionally a Japanese poem consisting of three short lines that do not rhyme. The origins of haiku poems can be traced back as far as the 9th century. A haiku is considered to be more than a type of poem; it is a way of looking at the physical world and seeing something deeper, like the very nature of existence. It should leave the reader with a strong feeling or impression.
                </p>
                <p>Defining haiku in terms of syllables and sentences becomes complicated once you translate the poetry across languages. Some translators argue that 12 English syllables would correlate more closely to the 17 sounds called "on" used by Japanese haiku poets. Another structural difference born out by translation is that Japanese haiku are written straight across in one line, while English-speaking poets use two line breaks to separate their poem into three lines.
                </p>
                <p>However, there is a common structure that most haiku poems follow. It is the 5-7-5 structure, where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The entire poem consists of just three lines, with 17 syllables in total</li>
                <li>The first line is 5 syllables</li>
                <li>The second line is 7 syllables</li>
                <li>The third line is 5 syllables</li>
            </ul>
